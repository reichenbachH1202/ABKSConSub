# ABKSConSub
It is an attribute-based keyword search scheme for blockchain-enabled content subscription services.
Content subscription service is an effective communication method that allows multiple participants to exchange information in an asynchronous and many-to-many manner. Due to the booming development of cloud computing, cloud-based systems are the most appropriate platform for content subscription services. Focus on the requirements of fine-grained access control, keyword search, traitor tracing, revocation, etc, we propose an attribute-based keyword search (ABKS) scheme for content subscription service systems, which simultaneously features blockchain-enable traitor tracing, user revocation, online/ofï¬‚ine encryption, and lightweight decryption, enabling fine-grained sharing of subscription content and access control to subscription content among multiple users. We prove the proposed scheme achieves IND-CPA security and can be against keyword guessing attacks as well as ensuring secure revocation, key exposure attack resistance, and efficient traitor tracing. Performance analysis shows that the proposed scheme ABKSConSub is efficient compared to related schemes and is practical for content subscription services.
